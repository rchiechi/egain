# EGaIn: Software to control and measure molecular junctions

This is the software we use in [our lab](https://www.rcclab.com) to measure the J/V properties of molecular junctions. It supports serial communication with a [Keithley Model 6430 Sub-Femtoamp Remote SourceMeter](https://www.tek.com/en/low-level-sensitive-and-specialty-instruments/high-resistance-low-current-electrometers-series-650-8). We use an [RS-232 to USB](https://iotmart.advantech.com/s/product/bb232usb9m/01t1W000009hiA5QAI) adapter. Data are written to text files formatted for ingestion by our [GaussFit](https://github.com/rchiechi/GaussFit) software.

The "EGaIn setup" consists of a syringe full of eutectic Ga-In suspended over a substrate. Tips and junctions can be formed manually or through software by entering the IP address of a [Newport ESP302 3-Axis controller](https://www.newport.com/f/esp30x-3-axis-dc-and-stepper-motion-controller) that is connected to the measurement stage. thermoelectric measurements can be performed using an Arduino device flashed with the [peltier.ino](/rchiechi/egain/tree/main/thermo/arduino/peltier) file. We will eventually include schematics as well.
